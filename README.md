[#288](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/57zcbm/20161017_challenge_288_easy_detecting_alliteration/)
Alliteration is defined as "the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words." It's a stylistic literary device identified by the repeated sound of the first consonant in a series of multiple words, or the repetition of the same sounds or of the same kinds of sounds at the beginning of words or in stressed syllables of a phrase. The first known use of the word to refer to a literary device occurred around 1624. A simple example is "Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers".
